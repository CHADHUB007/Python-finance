## The code you show uses the yfinance library to download Amazon Stock (AMZN) price history from Yahoo Finance. The historical data is then loaded into a Pandas DataFrame to calculate certain variables such as the daily return and the 50-day moving average.

Based on these variables, an investment strategy is defined based on buying the share if its current price is above the 50-day moving average and selling it if it is below. This is done by assigning values ​​to a column called "position" in the Pandas DataFrame, and then the performance of the strategy is calculated in another column called "strategy".

Finally, the performance of the strategy is evaluated and compared to a buy and hold strategy for the stock. The two strategies are plotted using matplotlib and the result is shown.
